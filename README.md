# Student-App
**Built:** March 2019 – March 2020

Welcome to the **YRDSB Student Planner App**, an all-purpose student utility app that was originally designed for Bayview Secondary School and/or the York Region District School Board. Talks with the school board's digital literacy team regarding the publication of this app as an official school app were underway, but alas, COVID had put it all to an end >.<

## Features
- Repolished view of your school's official Google Calendar, with the ability to set your own reminder push notifications;
- Real-time school announcements updates through the Twitter API;
- Customizable personal planning agenda, designed specifically to help students keep track of high school assignment deadlines; and
- Passwordless user authentication through email-based student number verification.
